Creating a simple calculator application in Java is a great way to get started with the language. Here's a step-by-step guide to building a basic command-line calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

1-Create a new Java file called Calculator.java.

2-Define a Calculator class with a main method:
public class Calculator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Calculator logic will be implemented here
    }

}
3-Create a method called calculate that takes two double arguments and an operation char:
public static double calculate(double num1, double num2, char operation) {
        double result = 0;
        switch (operation) {
            case '+':
                result = num1 + num2;
                break;
            case '-':
                result = num1 - num2;
                break;
            case '*':
                result = num1 * num2;
                break;
            case '/':
                if (num2 == 0) {
                    System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
                    return 0;
                }
                result = num1 / num2;
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Error: Invalid operation. Please use +, -, *, or /.");
                return 0;
        }
        return result;
    }
4-Modify the main method to accept user input and call the calculate method:

public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ");
        char operation = scanner.next().charAt(0);

        double result = calculate(num1, num2, operation);

        System.out.printf("Result: %.2f %c %.2f = %.2f%n", num1, operation, num2, result);

        scanner.close();
    }
5-Compile and run the Calculator.java file:
javac Calculator.java
java Calculator
This simple calculator application accepts two numbers, an operation, and displays the result. You can further enhance this application by adding more features like handling more complex operations, error handling, or creating a graphical user interface (GUI).

As a beginner, it's essential to understand the basics of Java programming, such as variables, data types, methods, loops, and conditional statements. Once you're comfortable with these concepts, you can explore more advanced Java features and build more complex applications.


Here is a simple calculator application in Java:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Calculator {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): ");
        char operation = scanner.next().charAt(0);

        double result = calculate(num1, num2, operation);

        System.out.printf("Result: %.2f %c %.2f = %.2f%n", num1, operation, num2, result);

        scanner.close();
    }

    public static double calculate(double num1, double num2, char operation) {
        double result = 0;
        switch (operation) {
            case '+':
                result = num1 + num2;
                break;
            case '-':
                result = num1 - num2;
                break;
            case '*':
                result = num1 * num2;
                break;
            case '/':
                if (num2 == 0) {
                    System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
                    return 0;
                }
                result = num1 / num2;
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Error: Invalid operation. Please use +, -, *, or /.");
                return 0;
        }
        return result;
    }
}

To run this application, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. Then, you can compile the Calculator.java file using the javac command:

1-javac Calculator.java

After the compilation is successful, you can run the program using the java command:
This will run the calculator application, which will prompt you to enter two numbers and an operation. The program will then perform the specified operation and display the result.
Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different features and functionalities. As a beginner, it's essential to understand the basics of Java programming, such as variables, data types, methods, loops, and conditional statements. Once you're comfortable with these concepts, you can explore more advanced Java features and build more complex applications.

If you have any questions or need help with the code, you can refer to the Java documentation, tutorials, and forums available online. The Java community is active and supportive, and there are many resources available to help you learn and grow as a Java developer.  

It was a wonderful experience. I liked it very much and I love it. Thank you very much to (CS50) for his wonderful effort, and thank you to David, and thank you to everyone who contributed to teaching us something. I send a message of love and appreciation to all of you, and thank you very much. I love you.
